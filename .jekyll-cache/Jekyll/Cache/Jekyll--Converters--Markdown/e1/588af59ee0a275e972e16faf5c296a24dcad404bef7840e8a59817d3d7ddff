I"í<p>So here we are again to measure the presence of deep learning in the major vision conferences, with one more to the list. Here you can check the previous <a href="http://localhost:5000/deep-learning-scraping/">posts</a> <a href="http://localhost:5000/deep-learning-plateau/">of</a> <a href="http://localhost:5000/deep-learning-takes-over-again/">the</a> <a href="http://localhost:5000/deep-learning-evolution/">saga</a>.<br />
<br />
Here the evolution of the results using XKCD style, as described in this <a href="http://localhost:5000/xkcd-deep-learning/">blog post</a>:

<p>So itâ€™s still growing! But we start to see a pattern hereâ€¦ what if we separate CVPR from the rest? Here we have it:<br />

<br />
<br />
Interesting! It seems like CVPR goes ahead of ECCV and ICCV hereâ€¦ maybe because many of those papers are resubmissions from CVPR?
<br />
<br />
In any case, it seems to be saturatingâ€¦ maybe people donâ€™t put deep-inducing words in the title anymore because theyâ€™re taken for granted? Or because this space is being taken by the new kids in class (LSTMs and GANs)? Letâ€™s find out!

Well, even though theyâ€™re still at more modest percentages, theyâ€™re growing! But wait, whatâ€™s that GAN peak in CVPR 2013? It comes from one paper titled â€œRepresenting and Discovering Adversarial Team Behaviors Using Player Rolesâ€ ğŸ˜‚. Close enough ğŸ˜….

See you in Hawaii!</p>
